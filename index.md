# Ashish Samson's First CS193 Homework

```
My favorite things about CS193 are:

- the useful CS skills and knowledge we will be taught
- the location and environment of the Lecture Hall
- the extremely long walk from my residence hall to the Physics Building
- the use of GitHub
- the knowledgeable TAs and humorous presentations
- the one time a week optional Practice Study Observation
- the ATTENDANCE QUIZZES?!?!
